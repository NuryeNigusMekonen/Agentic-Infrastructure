# Execution Plan - Phase Zero

## Purpose
Translate strategy into ordered execution without writing code.
This plan defines sequencing, not implementation.

## Phase 0 - Foundation
• Research domain and market
• Establish architectural direction
• Secure development environment
• Connect MCP telemetry

## Phase 1 - Specification
• Define functional requirements
• Define technical contracts
• Define agent behaviors

## Phase 2 - Skills and Tooling
• Define runtime agent skills
• Define developer MCP tooling
• Separate build-time and run-time concerns

## Phase 3 - Validation
• Write failing tests
• Enforce spec alignment
• Automate checks

## Phase 4 - Implementation
Implementation begins only after all previous phases are complete and reviewed.

## Guardrails
If a phase is incomplete, the next phase must not begin.
