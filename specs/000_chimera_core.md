# Chimera Core Specification - v0
## Objective
Define the foundational intent of Project Chimera.
This document is the root specification.
All future specs must align with it.

## System Definition
Project Chimera is an autonomous influencer system.
It operates through multiple AI agents coordinated by a central orchestrator.

Agents are persistent.
They possess identity, memory, and operational constraints.

## Core Principles
• Spec-driven development only
• MCP as the sole integration layer
• Human governance by exception
• Traceability over speed
• Autonomy with boundaries

## Constraints
• No direct API calls from agents
• No code generation without specs
• All actions must be auditable
• Financial actions require explicit review logic

## Agent Capabilities
At a conceptual level, agents must:
• Observe trends
• Generate content
• Interact socially
• Learn from outcomes
• Operate within budgets

Implementation is intentionally undefined here.

## Success Criteria
The system is successful when:
• Agents act independently without chaos
• Humans intervene only when necessary
• Behavior is explainable and reproducible

This file must change rarely.
